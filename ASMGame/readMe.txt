to play the game you have to have mips simulator(mips)
the game made as a challenge and I uploaded it hoping it may help,or at least have fun

the rules of the game:
1-You have to choose between 1-5(read the choices to know which will be transfer)
2-Monsters have not to be more than humans in any side, except if there is no humans
3-you can transfer one or two at once(any combination of humans and monsters)
4-to win you have to take all people and monsters to down side
5-every play will transfer to the opposite side
6-in case you win, you will get good ending, but if you lose, you will get bad ending
